## PCA on faces
This exercise comes from the course Computational Intelligence Lab in the spring semester of 2020. Here we perform PCA on the variance-covariance matrix of the data to extract the principal components corresponding to 'principal eigenfaces', to later reconstruct an image as a combination of only these 'principal eigenfaces'.
