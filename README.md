# ETH-exercises
some graded and ungraded homeworks from different courses offered at ETH Zurich 

## PCA on faces
This exercise comes from the course Computational Intelligence Lab in the spring semester of 2020. Here we perform PCA on the variance-covariance matrix of the data to extract the principal components corresponding to 'principal eigenfaces', to later reconstruct an image as a combination of only these 'principal eigenfaces'.

## Signal Processing & Wavelets
This exercises comes from the course Computational Intelligence Lab in the spring semester of 2020. Here we represent our signal in a different basis, namely the Haar basis. We then try to get rid of noise by treshholding the signal in the Haar basis, and then to transform it back into the original basis.
